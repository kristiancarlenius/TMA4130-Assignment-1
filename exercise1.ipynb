    "The function below extends the function implemented in Problem 2 above to a general amount of points. The function takes in input a 1D-array of points $x=x_0,\\ldots,x_m$ that serves for visualization purposes (as above) and compute functions $L_i(x)$ (different from the above ones) for every point $P_i$ in the 1D-array of points $P=P_0,\\ldots,P_n$. The function outputs a 2D-array `results` of size `nxm` where `results[i,j]`$=L_i(x_j)$. The code compiles without errors, but there are two errors in the code that you have to spot. This time the for loops are made explicit for didactic purposes. Hint: for three points you should recover the results above. It can be useful to plot the various $L_i(x)$ as done in Problem 2.  "
